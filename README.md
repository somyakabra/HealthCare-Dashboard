## Impact of the Project
The healthcare dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the hospital's performance in managing patient wait times, categorized into outpatient, day case, and inpatient. Here are the primary impacts:

1. Enhanced Monitoring and Decision-Making: By visualizing the data, hospital administrators can track the wait times over different periods and identify trends or spikes in patient wait lists, allowing for timely interventions.

2. Improved Resource Allocation: The detailed breakdown by case type (outpatient, day case, inpatient) and age profile helps in understanding which segments are most affected, enabling better resource allocation and management.

3. Patient Care Optimization: Understanding the average and median wait times for different specialties and age groups can help in strategizing to reduce wait times and improve patient care and satisfaction.

4. Operational Efficiency: The historical data trend analysis allows the hospital to assess the effectiveness of past measures and plan future strategies to handle patient loads more efficiently.

## Primary Problems Addressed
1. High Wait Times: The dashboard highlights the high wait times for different types of cases and age groups, which is crucial for patient satisfaction and outcomes. For instance, the latest month wait list is significantly high at 709K.

2. Identification of Bottlenecks: By visualizing the wait times across different specialties and case types, the hospital can identify specific areas (like paediatric respiratory medicine, ophthalmology, etc.) that require immediate attention.

3. Age-Specific Challenges: The dashboard shows how different age groups are affected by wait times, enabling targeted interventions for the most vulnerable populations.

4. Historical Data Analysis: The trend graphs show how the patient wait lists have evolved over time, providing insights into whether implemented measures have been effective or need adjustment.

## Dataset Details
1. Inpatient Dataset: This dataset includes data on patients who are admitted to the hospital and stay overnight or longer. Key metrics for inpatients include admission rates, wait times, and length of stay.

2. Outpatient Dataset: This dataset includes data on patients who visit the hospital for treatment but do not stay overnight. Key metrics for outpatients include visit rates, wait times, and frequency of visits.

3. Visualization Insights
a) Latest Month Wait List: 709K patients, compared to 640K in the previous year, indicating an increase in patient wait times.
b) Case Type Distribution: The pie chart shows the distribution of overall cases by type, with outpatients making up the largest portion.
c) Age Profile Wait Times: The bar graph highlights how wait times are distributed across different age groups and time bands.
d) Specialty-Specific Wait Times: The list on the right provides average and median wait times for different specialties, identifying areas with the longest waits.
e) Trend Analysis: The line graphs at the bottom show the trends in total cases by archive date and case type, with a notable increase in outpatient cases over time.

Steps Followed
## 1) Data Overview
Dataset consist of two different types of dataset
   a) **Inpatient** : a patient who stays in a hospital while under treatment.
   b) **Outpatient** : a patient who receives medical treatment without being admitted to a hospital.

## 2) Requirement Gathering
   a) Identify Stakeholder
   b) Understand Business Objectives
   c) Higher Level Data Study(Data type,Data sources)
   d) Define Scope(Document KPI)

## 3) Data Collection
Collecting Data from multiple sources and importing data into powerBI. Here we Use multiple Excel files collate them together and then import it into powerBI.
## 4)Transformation & Modelling
Check the data type First. Make sure you have same number of Rows and columns in other to append them. In home we append queries slect append queries as new option. Now for modeling the data select model where we have 3 tables Inpatient , outpatient and all data
## 5)Visualization Blueprint
## 6)Layout & Design Workflow
## 7)Add Interactivity & Navigation
